=head1 NAME

LWP::UserAgent::Snapshot - modifies the behaviour of C<LWP::UserAgent> to record and playback data.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  use WWW::Mechanize;
  use LWP::UserAgent::Snapshot;

  @WWW::Mechanize::ISA = ('LWP::UserAgent::Snapshot');

  my $mech = WWW::Mechanize->new;

  $mech->record_to("data_dir"); # turn on recording to data_dir/

  # naviate some web pages

  WWW::Mechanize->record_to(undef); # turn off recording
  WWW::Mechanize->mock_from("data_dir"); # turn on playback

  # Navigating the same urls should now work as before, but without
  # any network access. This is useful for testing.


=head1 DESCRIPTION

If this subclass of C<LWP::UserAgent> is inserted into the C<@ISA>
inheritance list of C<WWW::Mechanize>, it allows it to record request
and response data to a set of files, then play back responses from
that data.

For suggestions on the use of this class in testing, see
L<LWP::UserAgent::Snapshot::UsageGuide>.

=head1 CLASS METHODS

=head2 C<< $class->record_to($dir) >>

If C<$dir> is supplied, turns on recording to that directory. Otherwise,
turns off recording.

=cut

sub record_to 
{
    my $class = shift;
    my $dir = shift;
    Carp::croak "no such directory '$dir'" unless !defined $dir or -d $dir;

    $DUMP_DIR = $dir;
}


=head2 C<< $class->mock_from($dir) >>

If C<$dir> is supplied, turns on playback from that
directory. Otherwise, turns off playback.

=cut

sub mock_from
{
    my $class = shift;
    my $dir = shift;
    Carp::croak "no such directory '$dir'" unless !defined $dir or -d $dir;

    $MOCK_DIR = $dir;
}




=head1 PUBLIC INSTANCE METHODS

=head2 C<< $response = $obj->simple_request($request) >>

Overrides C<< LWP::UserAgent->simple_request >> and implements the
recording/playback mechanism, when enabled.

=head1 CAVEATS

Because we associate each URL visited with its content as downloaded
on the first visit, this means we assume the website does not change -
in particular, that a given URL's content does not depend on when it's
visited, by what route, or other stateful information.

=head1 SEE ALSO

L<WWW::Mechanize> and L<LWP::UserAgent> for general information.

Similar tools include the unix C<wget> command.
